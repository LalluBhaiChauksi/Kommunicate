Two people whom I would like to choose from my batch if I start a software company will be - Gaurav Shukla and Gaurika Goel as we have already worked on some projects helping each other. We also are proficient in our own domains like Gaurav is well skilled at data science and machine learning and Gaurika has some experience over the Frontend part. As a software company requires the latest technology, we are well equipped with the skills required to manage and run the company smoothly.
